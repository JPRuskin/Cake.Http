# Implementing Cake.Recipe

The main focus of this release was to introduce Cake.Recipe as the main build engine for the project.  Going forward, this means that Cake.Http will be consistent with the other projects in this organisation, and as a result, more maintainable going forward.

Here are all the details about the closed issues:

## Improvement

- [__#3__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Http/issues/3) Convert this repo to use Cake.Recipe

## Documentation

- [__#5__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Http/pull/5) Fix syntax error in README example
